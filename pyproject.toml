# UP007: `Optional[{type}]` is preferred over `None | {type}`
# ANN002: A better use case than kwargs, but ignored at present due to a lack of desire to fix existing cases
# ANN003: kwargs are often highly dynamically typed dicts so this is more of a hassle
# ANN101/ANN102: Type checkers are good at figuring self and cls out, this is just line noise
# C408: dict() calls are somewhat useful for constructing a kwarg in a way that has better visual clarity
# SIM108: Tenaries are often less readable than simple if-else blocks
